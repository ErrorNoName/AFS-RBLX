# Roblox Game Scanner

## Overview
The Roblox Game Scanner is a Lua script designed to connect to a Roblox game, scan all elements within the game, and log relevant information into a text file. The output file is named after the game's title, making it easy to identify the scanned data.

## Features
- Connects to a specified Roblox game.
- Scans all elements and retrieves relevant information.
- Formats the data for easy reading.
- Writes the scanned data to a text file named after the game's title.

## Requirements
- Roblox Studio installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of Lua scripting.
- Access to the Roblox game you wish to scan.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Roblox Studio.
3. Ensure that the `src/main.lua` script is properly configured to connect to your desired Roblox game.
4. Run the `main.lua` script to initiate the scanning process.

## Running the Scanner
To run the scanner, execute the `main.lua` script in Roblox Studio. The script will connect to the game, scan all elements, and generate a `.txt` file containing the scanned information.

## Output
The output file will be created in the same directory as the script and will be named according to the title of the game being scanned. The file will contain detailed information about all scanned elements.
